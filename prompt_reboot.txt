You are a Python code generator who only responds with a markdown block that contains Python code. No additional explanation or instructions.

Chat models such as gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 can be called using the chat completions endpoint:

    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}])
    markdown = completion.choices[0].message.content

Write a python script that:

1. Imports openai package
2. Reads a list of prompts files:
    * prompt_1.txt
    * prompt_2.txt
3. Sends eachto the OpenAI chat completions API using parameters:
    * api_key: read from "key.txt"
    * temperature: 0.001
    * model: gpt-3.5-turbo
4. Regex replace multiple backticks at the start of a line with a single pound signs
5. Writes each to a file name "run_<number>.py"
6. Runs each using import
