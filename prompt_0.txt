Chat models such as gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 can be called using the chat completions endpoint:

    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}])
    print(completion.choices[0].message.content)

Write a python script that:

1. Reads a prompt from "prompt_1.txt"
2. Sends it to the OpenAI chat completions API using parameters:
    * api_key: read from "key.txt"
    * temperature: 0.01
    * model: gpt-3.5-turbo
3. Write the code to "run_1.py"
