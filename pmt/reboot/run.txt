From openai-python: Chat models such as gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 can be called using the chat completions endpoint.

    from openai import OpenAI
    completion = OpenAI(api_key="..").chat.completions.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}])
    print(completion.choices[0].message.content)

Write a script to:

1. Print "Bootstrapping.."
2. Read a list of prompts files:
    * pmt/api/run/write.txt
    * pmt/api/run_cached/write.txt
    * pmt/api/run_prompt/write.txt
    * pmt/api/snapshot/run.txt
    * pmt/main/write.txt
3. For each prompt, call the chat completions API:
    * api_key: read from "key.txt"
    * system: "You are a Python code generator who only replies with Python code. No additional explanation or instructions."
    * model: gpt-3.5-turbo
    * temperature: 0.001
4. Regex replace "[`]{2,}" with "#"
5. Run each using exec
