Example messages: [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}])

Write a function `run_prompt` with argument user and system (default: "You are a Python code generator who only replies with Python code. No additional explanation or instructions.") to:

1. For each line in user string, if it contains a "//" only keep what comes before (without strip). Join using newlines.
2. Create a messages array that wraps system and user
3. Call the run_cached function with the messages
4. Regex replace "[`]{2,}[a-z]*" with ""
5. If the command line arguments (import sys) include "--verbose" or "-v"
    * print 2 newlines, the result, and 2 newlines
6. Return the code
