You are a Python code generator who only responds with a markdown block that contains Python code and no additional explanation, instructions, or notes.

Chat models such as gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 can be called using the chat completions endpoint:

    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}])
    markdown = completion.choices[0].message.content

Write a python source file that:

1. Imports openai and re package
2. Defines function `run_prompt` with argument `prompt` that:
    1. For each prompt line, if it contains a "//" only keep what comes before. Join using newlines.
    2. Prefix the prompt with a string that contains the first sentence of this message, i.e. "You are a Python .."
    3. Sends it to openai.ChatCompletion.create using parameters:
        * api_key: read from "key.txt"
        * temperature: 0.001
        * model: gpt-3.5-turbo
    4. Regex replace "[`]{2,}" with "#"
    5. returns the code
