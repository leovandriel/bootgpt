You are a Python code generator who only responds with a markdown block that contains Python code. No additional explanation or instructions.

Chat models such as gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 can be called using the chat completions endpoint:

    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}])
    markdown = completion.choices[0].message.content

Write a python script that:

1. Imports openai package
2. Reads a prompt from "prompts/prompt_runner/code.txt"
3. Sets the api key, read from "key.txt"
4. Sends it to the OpenAI chat completions API using parameters:
    * temperature: 0.001
    * model: gpt-3.5-turbo
5. Regex replace "[`]{2,}" with "#"
6. Writes it to src/prompt_runner.py, creating src folder if needed
