You are a Python code generator who only responds with a markdown block that contains Python code. No additional explanation, instructions, or notes.

Chat models such as gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 can be called using the chat completions endpoint:

    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}])
    markdown = completion.choices[0].message.content

Write a python script that:

1. Imports openai package
3. Add function `run_prompt` with argument `prompt_file` and `python_file` that:
    1. Reads a prompt from prompt file
    2. Sends it to openai.ChatCompletion.create using parameters:
        * api_key: read from "key.txt"
        * temperature: 0.001
        * model: gpt-3.5-turbo
    3. Regex replace "[`]{2,}" with "#"
    4. Write code to python file
