Write the following script to builder.py:

1. If no command line arguments are provided, ask the user "What would you like to build? ", else concatenate the arguments
2. Create a folder `app` if it does not exist
3. Call `run_prompt` (import from src.api) with the user input as argument
4. Write the result to "app/run.py"
5. Print "Run with: python -m app.run"

Make sure to import the right packages
