// Write an application that builds applications

Write a script to:

1. Import run_prompt from src.prompt_runner
2. Ask the user "What would you like to build? "
3. Create a folder `app` if it does not exist
4. Call `run_prompt` with the user input as argument, and writes the result to "app/run.py"
5. Print "Run with 'python -m app.run'"
