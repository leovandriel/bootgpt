// Write an application that builds applications

Write a script that:
1. Import run_prompt from src.prompt_runner
2. Asks the user "What would you like to build? "
3. Creates a folder `app` if it does not exist
4. Calls `run_prompt` with the user input as argument, and writes the result to "app/run.py"
5. Prints "Your application is located in the `app` folder"
