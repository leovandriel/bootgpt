// Write an application that writes applications

Example messages: [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an assistant"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}])

Define function `handle` with argument `request` string:

1. Read prompts/request/handle/system.txt
2. Keep a list of messages, initialized with system content and user request 
3. Loop over the following:
    * Call `run_cached` (import src.api) with messages argument
    * If the result is already in messages, throw an error
    * Append the result as assistant's code to messages
    * Redirect stdout to string and run the code with exec
    * Append output to messages (role user)
    * If output is empty, break out of loop

Make sure to import the right packages
