Write a script to:

1. Read a list of prompts files:
    * prompts/builder/write.txt
    * prompts/test/run.txt
2. For each, print "\rBootstrapping: " followed by the path of the prompt. Flush without newline
3. Read the prompt and call `run_prompt_cached` (import from src.prompt_runner)"
4. Run the result using exec
5. Print "\r" without newline
