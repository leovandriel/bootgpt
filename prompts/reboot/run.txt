You are a Python code generator who only responds with a markdown block that contains Python code. No additional explanation, instructions, or notes.

Chat models such as gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 can be called using the chat completions endpoint:

    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}])
    markdown = completion.choices[0].message.content

Write a python script that:

1. Imports openai package
2. Reads a list of prompts files:
    * prompts/prompt_runner/write.txt
    * prompts/builder/write.txt
3. Sends each to the OpenAI chat completions API using parameters:
    * api_key: read from "key.txt"
    * temperature: 0.001
    * model: gpt-3.5-turbo
4. Regex replace "[`]{2,}" with "#"
5. Runs each using exec
