From openai-python: Chat models such as gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 can be called using the chat completions endpoint.

    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}])
    print(completion.choices[0].message.content)

    * prompts/api/snapshot/run.txt
    * prompts/main/write.txt

    * system: "You are a Python code generator who only replies with Python code. No additional explanation or instructions."
    * parameters:
        * api_key: read from "key.txt"
        * model: gpt-3.5-turbo
        * temperature: 0.001
