Write a function `run_prompt_cached` with argument `prompt` and `system` (default: "You are a Python code generator who only replies with Python code. No additional explanation or instructions.") to:

1. Compute the md5 checksum of the prompt and system combined
2. Concatenate a filename, for folder 'cache', with the md5 checksum as name, and "py" extension
3. If the file does not exists
    * Call `run_prompt`
    * Save the result to the file, creating cache folder if needed
4. If the command line arguments (import sys) include "--verbose" or "-v"
    * print 2 newlines, the result, and 2 newlines
5. Return the result
